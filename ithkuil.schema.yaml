    Input Method for Ithkuil and The New Ithkuil Language
    Note that since Ithkuil use ⟨ż⟩ for /d͡z/, which is inputted by “z.”,
    use “z,” to type ⟨ẓ⟩ in The New Ithkuil Language.
    “-” is used to type the character for high tone, ⟨ˉ⟩.
    To type a hyphen specified for syllabification, use “=”.
    The result character is a non-breaking hyphen, which means a word
    won’t wrap at it even if the word falls at the end of a line.
    To type the original character, input the character twice.
    Tripling the last character of the input results in a transformed
    character plus the original character.
